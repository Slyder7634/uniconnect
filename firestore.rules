/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a user-ownership model for student profiles and grades, while providing public read access to course and announcement data.
 * Data Structure:
 * - /students/{studentId}: Student profile information, owned by the student.
 * - /courses/{courseId}: Course information, publicly readable.
 * - /teachers/{teacherId}: Teacher information.
 * - /announcements/{announcementsId}: University announcements, publicly readable.
 * - /grades/{gradeId}: Student grades, accessible only by the student.
 * - /studentCommunityChat/{messageId}: Chat messages for the student community.
 * - /writingPortal/{resourceId}: Collaborative writing resources.
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is generally disallowed to protect privacy.
 * - Public read access is granted only to collections explicitly intended for public consumption.
 * - Write access to certain collections is restricted.
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Ownership checks are performed using the `studentId` in the document.
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - Public and private data are stored in separate collections to simplify rules and improve performance.
